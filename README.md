# Arranging and Analyzing Data in R

This is the first course of the Data Science for Health Research Specialization offered by the University of Michigan through the Coursera platform. In this repository, I will present two main products: recreating the Global Findex Indicator Table, 2017, developed by the World Bank, and a plot of the accounts per income category. The two products in this repository were developed using the tidyverse library. Tidyverse is used to cleanse, manipulate, and transform data. Various functionalities were used:

- group_by to group data by specific fields
- Summarize to aggregate data
- mutate to create new variables
- arrange to sort data
- inner_join, full_join, etc. to join different data frames
- pivot_wider and pivot_longer to change the structure of data
- select to extract specific fields
- filter to filter data
- ggplot to visualize data

 The data set for developing the indicator table and the plot can be downloaded from [this link](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3324/get-microdata).
